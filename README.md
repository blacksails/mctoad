This is the config repository for the toad minecraft server.

In order to test configuration locally we can provision the server using
[vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/): `vagrant up`. This spins up a vm and
runs the [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) playbook on the vm which installs
the server and all required tools.
